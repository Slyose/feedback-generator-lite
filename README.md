# feedback-generator-lite

A quick &amp; dirty version of the full fledged feedback generator that was put together in a couple nights, temporarily serving in it's place until the proper and polished version is done.

If you want more aspects for a task, go in the feedbacks.json and add them. In order to update the site to be aware of those new aspects, you will have to reset feedback data using the button on the homepage. (this clears local storage and sets the feedback data using the json file.)

# TODO

- ~~Persistent storage of user-generated feedback~~  Done!
- Removal of unnecessary nesting in an array of feedback
- Replacemnet of json file in favour of a proper db & backend
- Ability to add aspects via the frontend
- Host
