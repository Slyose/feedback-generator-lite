# feedback-generator-lite

A quick &amp; dirty version of the full fledged feedback generator that was put together in a couple nights, temporarily serving in it's place until the proper and polished version is done.

If you want more aspects for a task, go in the feedbacks.json and add them

**Added feedbacks currently live only in state, so if you refresh the page you WILL lose any custom feedback that was added in edit mode.**

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
