# feedback-generator-lite

A quick &amp; dirty version of the full fledged feedback generator that was put together in a couple nights, temporarily serving in it's place until the proper and polished version is done.

If you want more aspects for a task, go in the feedbacks.json and add them

**Added feedbacks currently live only in state, so if you refresh the page you WILL lose any custom feedback that was added in edit mode.**

# TODO

- Persistent storage of user-generated feedbacks
- Removal of unnecessary nesting in an array of feedbacks
- Replacemnet of json file in favour of a proper db & backend
- Ability to add aspects via the frontend
- Host
